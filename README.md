# Santander2022_DevWeek_BackEnd
Kind of a very simple back-end bank application built during Santander development week 2022.


From 2022/05/02 to 2022/05/05 I created this simple back-end application to enjoy possibilities with Maven, Java, Eclipse, Spring Boot, Santander examples, etc.
It was during Santander development week 2022, a time to put hands on some app programming technologies. It served very well as an initiative to recycle some IT professional and also as a preparation for the incoming Santander Bootcamp 2022.
